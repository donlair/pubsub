we need to verify that they types were correctly implemented

have parallel sonnet subagents review the types files created in @src/types/ and
compare the actual implementation against the plan. Assign one file per subagent.
Ensure that all files are reviewed.

Once all reviews are done, synthesize their findings, prioritize tasks and then
update the implementation plan.

Do NOT implement any code changes.
